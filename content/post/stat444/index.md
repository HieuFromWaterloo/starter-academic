Provided the Washing D.C residential data set, our objective is to build statistical learning algorithms to predict the housing prices in the capital of the United States. In this project, we design 4 different models, all being trained and validated based on the Root Mean Squared Log Error (RMSLE) over 5-fold cross validation. The first model is smoothing, which has the error (RMLSE) of 0.19856. The second model is random forest, which produces the error (RMLSE) of 0.180. Third, our boosting model has an error of 0.16746. Lastly, we took the average of the predictions from random forest and boosting and get an error of 0.17162
