## Overview

LDA is one of the most important topic models in practice. On a high level, it provides a generative model
that describes how the documents in a dataset are generated; i.e. how words are sampled from multiple
topics to construct a document. This generative process follows a bag of words (BOW) assumption. Hence,
the order in which the word occurs is not taken into account. The core of topic modeling is to analyze unlabeled text data, discover the unknown number of topics and topic distribution in a unsupervised way. This is achieved by making use of statistical inference.
