## Overview

The financial sector is in the midst of a transformation. The Canadian industry, long dominated by "the Big Five" (RBC, CIBC, BMO, TD, and Scotia), is facing increasing competition with international banks and novel technologies such as robo-advisors. This shift is compounded by socioeconomic phenomenon including the foreboding of a North American recession and the global resurgence of populism. Hence, more than ever, financial institutions must identify ways to recruit and retain a loyal customer base. Targeted phone-based campaigns have long been useful tools to this end. In this project, we aim to discover the attributes of a successful telephone-based marketing campaign promoting financial services. In particular, we are interested in identifying the characteristics of clients who have subscribed to a term deposit with a bank after being contacted by a customer engagement representative. We will be utilizing campaign led by a Portuguese bank between 2008 and 2010 to fit a variety of classification models.
