Hi! My name is Hieu (pronounced as Hugh). I am from a beautiful country in South East Asia - Viet Nam. I am currently a Data Scientist at Royal Bank of Canada, Data & Analytics (DNA). My work and research focuses primarily on solving business problem using Natural Language Processing (NLP). I still have a lot to learn, improve and master.

In the past, I have worked on problems ranging from cybersecurity, fraud detection in financial transactions to equity/debt deals detection in north american capital markets.

I enjoy solving problems using math, reading, travelling, playing sports (soccer, basketball, pool, chess).
